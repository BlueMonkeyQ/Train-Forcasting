## Research Question
---

This project uses historical data provided by SNCR-Transilien, a French transit company, to predict a given train's crowding factor, which is defined as the ratio of pasengers on a train relative to its total possible capacity. Our supervised machine learning algorithm uses the crowding factor of previous trains at the current station and the crowding factor of the current train at previous stations to predict train occupancy rates in real time.
